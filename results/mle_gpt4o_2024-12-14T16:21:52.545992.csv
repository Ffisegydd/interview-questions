Can you explain how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction?,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction in data preprocessing
PCA identifies the axes of maximum variance in the data set, which are known as principal components
The first principal component captures the maximum variance, and each subsequent component captures the remaining variance in decreasing order
PCA works by transforming the original features into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components
Principal components are orthogonal, meaning they are independent of each other
PCA is performed by computing the covariance matrix of the data and then finding its eigenvectors and eigenvalues
Eigenvectors determine the direction of the new feature space, and eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance along those directions
Data is projected onto the selected principal components based on the eigenvectors to achieve dimensionality reduction
The number of principal components to retain is often chosen based on the cumulative explained variance
Dimensionality reduction with PCA can help improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and decrease computational cost
PCA assumes linear relationships and that the principal components capture the essence of data variance
Normalization of data is crucial before applying PCA to ensure all features contribute equally

What is the difference between a stationary and a non-stationary time series?,"A stationary time series has statistical properties like mean, variance, and autocorrelation that are constant over time
A non-stationary time series has statistical properties that change over time, such as trends or seasonal variations

What are ARIMA models and how are they used in time series analysis?,"ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
It is a popular statistical method for time series forecasting
ARIMA models capture standard temporal structures in time series data
The ""AutoRegressive"" part involves regressing the variable on its own lagged values
The ""Integrated"" part refers to the use of differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary
The ""Moving Average"" part incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations
ARIMA models are characterized by three parameters: p, d, and q
The parameter p denotes the number of lag observations in the model
The parameter d denotes the number of times that the raw observations are differenced
The parameter q denotes the size of the moving average window
ARIMA models require the time series data to be stationary
Stationarity means the statistical properties of a time series are consistent over time
Differencing can help make a time series stationary
Model selection involves identifying the appropriate values of p, d, and q
Model evaluation involves comparing model predictions to actual observations using metrics like RMSE or MAPE
ARIMA models can be extended to seasonal data to form SARIMA models by including seasonal parameters
SARIMA adds seasonal differences and seasonal lag components to account for seasonal effects
ARIMA is suitable for univariate time series analysis
Model fitting involves estimating the ARIMA parameters that minimize extra properties such as Autocorrelation of residual errors

Explain the role of decomposition in time series analysis and describe what components you would typically look for.,"Decomposition in time series analysis involves breaking down a time series into distinct components.
The primary components typically considered include trend, seasonality, and residual noise.
Trend represents the long-term progression in the data, indicating an overall increase or decrease over time.
Seasonality captures repetitive patterns or cycles at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or yearly.
Residual noise, also called the irregular component, accounts for random, unexplained variations that are not captured by trend or seasonality.
Decomposition helps in simplifying complex data sets by isolating these components, aiding in better analysis and interpretation.
Understanding the underlying components enhances forecasting accuracy and model selection in time series analysis.
Different decomposition techniques are used, such as classical decomposition, STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS), and decomposition based on moving averages.
Each technique offers unique advantages, with STL being robust for handling non-linear trends and various seasonal patterns.
Modeling after decomposition allows for targeted interventions, such as detrending or deseasonalizing the data, to improve predictive models.
